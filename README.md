## Acknowledgments

### How This Project Came Together
This project came about through a really interesting collaboration between **Adilbek Bazarkulov** (that's me!) and **Claude AI from Anthropic**. Working with Claude was genuinely helpful throughout the development process, providing assistance with:

- Architecture decisions and figuring out the best way to structure everything
- Code optimization and making things run smoothly
- Designing educational features that actually help people learn
- Debugging tricky problems (there were quite a few!)
- Writing documentation and keeping the code organized

This collaboration shows how humans and AI can work together to create something useful for education and science. Claude's assistance was invaluable, and I really appreciate the partnership in making this project better than I could have built alone.

### Special Thanks
- **The PubChem Team** at NCBI for maintaining such an incredible database and making it freely available
- **Claude AI from Anthropic**
- **Three.js Community** for creating amazing 3D graphics tools that work in browsers
- **Next.js Team** for building such a solid React framework
- **The Open Source Community** for all the incredible tools and libraries that made this possible

### Mission
moleXa exists to make molecular chemistry more accessible and engaging for students, teachers, and anyone curious about the molecular world. We believe in open science and think that powerful educational tools should be freely available to everyone. If this project helps even one student understand chemistry better, then all the work was worth it.
